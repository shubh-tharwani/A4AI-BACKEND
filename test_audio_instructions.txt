Test Audio File Instructions
============================

Since we cannot easily create a proper speech audio file programmatically, please use one of these options:

OPTION 1 - Record Your Own (RECOMMENDED):
1. Use your phone or computer to record a short voice message (5-10 seconds)
2. Say clearly: "Hello, this is a test message for the voice assistant. Can you hear me?"
3. Save as .wav, .mp3, or .flac format

OPTION 2 - Online Audio Samples:
1. Visit: https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds-zip/beep-07a.wav (short beep)
2. Or search for "sample speech audio wav file" on Google
3. Download a small audio file (under 1MB)

OPTION 3 - Convert Existing Audio:
1. Use any audio file you have
2. Convert to WAV format using online converters if needed
3. Ensure it's under 10MB

TESTING STEPS:
1. Start the server: python main.py
2. Open Postman or similar API client
3. POST request to: http://localhost:8000/voice-assistant/process
4. In Body, select "form-data"
5. Add key: "audio_file" (type: File)
6. Upload your audio file
7. Check terminal logs for detailed debugging info

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Google Speech API finds speech segments (count: 2)
- But returns empty transcript strings: '' (length: 0)
- This suggests audio format/quality issue rather than API connection problem

DEBUGGING INFO TO LOOK FOR:
- "Speech recognition results count: X"
- "Raw segment text 0: '...' (length: X)"
- "Final combined transcript: '...'"
