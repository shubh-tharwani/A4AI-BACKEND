üéØ VOICE ASSISTANT API - TESTING GUIDE
==========================================

## üîç CURRENT STATUS
‚úÖ Server running successfully on http://localhost:8000
‚úÖ Google Speech API connection working
‚úÖ Audio file upload and processing working
‚úÖ Google Speech API finds speech segments (2 segments detected)
‚ùå **ISSUE**: Empty transcripts returned (segments contain no text)

## üìä DEBUGGING RESULTS
From terminal logs, we can see:
- Audio file: "Quiz for fractions.wav" (618KB)
- Speech recognition finds: 2 segments  
- Raw segment text 0: '' (length: 0)
- Raw segment text 1: '' (length: 0)
- Final transcript: "No speech detected"

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE
**The audio files being tested are NOT actual human speech**
- Generated test files are just beeps/tones
- Google Speech-to-Text API requires actual human voice
- API correctly detects audio segments but can't transcribe non-speech sounds

## ‚úÖ SOLUTIONS TO TEST WITH REAL SPEECH

### OPTION 1: Record Your Own Voice (BEST)
```
1. Use your phone's voice recorder
2. Say clearly: "Hello, this is a test message for the voice assistant API"
3. Record for 5-10 seconds
4. Save as WAV format
5. Transfer to computer and test
```

### OPTION 2: Online Speech Samples
Visit these sites for free speech audio:
- https://freesound.org/ (search "speech test")
- https://voice.mozilla.org/common-voice (sample dataset)
- https://www.openslr.org/ (speech datasets)

### OPTION 3: Text-to-Speech Conversion
```
1. Use online TTS tools like:
   - https://ttsmaker.com/
   - https://www.naturalreaders.com/
2. Enter text: "Hello, this is a test for the voice assistant"
3. Generate and download WAV file
4. Test with the API
```

## üß™ HOW TO TEST THE API

### Step 1: Prepare Audio File
- Ensure file is actual human speech
- Format: WAV, MP3, or FLAC
- Duration: 5-30 seconds
- Size: Under 10MB

### Step 2: API Testing
```bash
# Method 1: Using curl
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/voice-assistant/process" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "audio_file=@your_speech_file.wav"

# Method 2: Using Postman
POST http://localhost:8000/voice-assistant/process
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Body: form-data
Key: audio_file (File type)
Value: Select your audio file
```

### Step 3: Check Results
Monitor terminal for debug logs:
```
Processing audio file: filename.wav, Size: XXXXX bytes
Speech recognition results count: X
Raw segment text 0: 'YOUR SPEECH TEXT HERE' (length: XX)
Final combined transcript: 'YOUR SPEECH TEXT HERE'
```

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Current Speech Recognition Config
```python
# Primary: Auto-detection (most reliable)
config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
    language_code="en-US",
    enable_automatic_punctuation=True
)

# Fallback: Format-specific detection  
config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
    language_code="en-US",
    enable_automatic_punctuation=True,
    encoding=detected_encoding,
    sample_rate_hertz=16000
)
```

### Supported Audio Formats
- WAV (LINEAR16) - 16kHz recommended
- MP3 - Standard bitrates
- FLAC - Lossless compression
- WEBM/OPUS - 48kHz for OPUS

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS
1. **Record a real speech sample** (5-10 seconds of your voice)
2. **Test the API** with the real audio file
3. **Check terminal logs** for successful transcript extraction
4. **Verify AI response generation** and text-to-speech conversion

## üìù EXPECTED SUCCESS LOG
```
Processing audio file: my_test.wav, Size: 156782 bytes, Extension: wav
Detected audio encoding: 1, Sample rate: 16000
Attempting speech recognition with auto-detection...
Speech recognition results count: 1
Processing result 0: alternatives count = 1
Raw segment text 0: 'Hello this is a test message for the voice assistant' (length: 52)
Added speech segment 0: 'Hello this is a test message for the voice assistant'
Final combined transcript: 'Hello this is a test message for the voice assistant' (parts: 1)
```

üéâ Once you have real speech audio, the API should work perfectly!
